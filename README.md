# AI Life Guidance Assignment

This repo contains a take home assignment for a 2 year experience AI and ML engineer.
The goal is to design a small life guidance system that mimics an astrology style engine without using any actual astrology data.

The system should:

* Ingest user profile data and life events from CSV files
* Build scoring or rule based logic that turns this data into "guidance" suggestions
* Experiment with at least one ML or ranking model to personalise suggestions
* Expose a simple CLI or notebook interface to generate guidance for a user
* Log basic evaluation metrics and examples

You are expected to spend about 10 to 12 hours across a week on this.
